# Make Calculator

Another calculator. Now the task is more difficult.

Create a `makeCalculator` function that returns an object that
has the following fields:
- Methods: `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`, `reset`, `operate`.
- The `result` property is initially 0.

How the calculator will work:
- Each `operate` call takes a callback and a number and sets the appropriate value to the `result` property.
- The `reset` method resets `result` value to 0.
- `add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide` are passed as callbacks to `operate` method.
- The `operate` and `reset` methods can be called in a chain.

Example:

```js
const calculator = makeCalculator();
